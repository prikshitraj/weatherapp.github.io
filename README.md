# weatherapp21
This is simple weather app where you can get weather information such as temperature,humidity,wind speed and shows whether it is sunny or cloudy day.
# How did I do?
I've used a weather API for weather information and provided a input field in the app. The user can search any city or country, they'll get all the information regarding the weather of the searched city.
